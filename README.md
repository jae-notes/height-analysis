# Height Analysis

This project explores a small height dataset to compare the **overall average height** with the **average height of adults (age ≥ 18)**.  
The goal is to demonstrate basic data analysis, filtering, and visualization using Python.

---

## Dataset

The dataset contains the following columns:

- `age`: age of individuals
- `height`: height in centimeters

The data includes both children and adults, which allows us to examine how age affects the overall average height.

---

## Analysis Steps

1. Load the dataset using **pandas**
2. Calculate:
   - Overall average height
   - Average height of adults (age ≥ 18)
3. Compare the two averages
4. Visualize the height distribution using a histogram

---

## Key Findings

- The **average height of adults** is higher than the **overall average height**
- This indicates that including children lowers the overall mean height
- A histogram helps visualize how heights are distributed across the dataset

---

## Visualization

The histogram shows:
- Distribution of heights
- A vertical line for the **overall average**
- A vertical line for the **adult average**

These lines make it easy to compare how the averages relate to the full distribution.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

## Notes

This is a small, exploratory project focused on clarity and correctness rather than scale.
