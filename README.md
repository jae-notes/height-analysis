# Height Analysis

## Overview
This project explores simple height patterns in a small dataset using Python and pandas.

## Questions
- How does average height differ between adults and the overall population?
- How do different baselines change analytical conclusions?

## Approach
I focus on clear, step by step analysis rather than complex models.
Each question is answered using simple pandas operations.

## Assumptions & Limitations
- Height is treated as the only variable.
- Other factors such as weight or body composition are not considered.
- This project is for learning and exploration.

## Tools
- Python
- pandas
